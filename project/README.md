# Functional Programming with Javascript 

### Big Picture

You are going to create a Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API. the dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. Your app will make use of all the functional concepts and practices you have learned in this course, and the goal is that you would become very comfortable using pure functions and iterating over, reshaping, and accessing information from complex API responses. 

### Getting Started

We have supplied some of the foundational code for you. So follow these steps to get started:

 - [ ] For this project we are using yarn as our package manager, so to install your depencies run:
